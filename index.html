The source code of a webpage, often HTML, is the underlying text that defines the structure and content of that page. It's essentially the blueprint that browsers use to render the visual page you see. You can view a webpage's source code by using your browser's "View Source" option or by using keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+U (Windows) or âŒ˜-Option-U (Mac).
